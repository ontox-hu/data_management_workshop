# Workshop overview

## Why you want to complete this workshop

incentives be here


## Learning objectives

After this workshop you:

 - Can store your research projects (data, code, manuscripts, etc) in a future proof way, that fascilitates collaboration, and saves you a lot of time if you ever want to revisit, share or alter your project. 
 - Know which information needs to be stored with data, and how to keep these together when collaborating with others.
 - Can keep your projects under version control, so you can always backtrace what changed, when, and by whom.
 - Applied all this to your current most active research project
 - Can start tomorrow (or well, next monday) with using this workflow in your everyday work.
