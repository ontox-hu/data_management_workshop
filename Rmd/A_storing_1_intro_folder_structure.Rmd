## Reproducible

Suppose you share your data with someone. Would they come to the same results and conclusions?

Should they?

What would they need to replicate your results?

<!-- You have been trained in making your work replicable: other people should be able to repeat the exact same experiment based on your report (methods section). -->
<!-- But would they reach the exact same results? -->
<!-- What would they need to have to get the same results?  -->

## Reproducible

Results and conclusions depend on more than data:

 - information about the data (meta data)
 - outlier selection
 - choices in analyses
 - context
 - interpretations
 - versions of software used
 - ... 

Thus, whole project needs to be clear and sharable, not just the data.


<!-- Results and conclusions depend on more than data. Also interpretations, choices in analyses, context... Thus, whole project needs to be clear and sharable  -->

## Example: same data, other conclusions

## Example: same data, other conclusions

 - 29 research groups got the same question, with the same dataset to solve it.
 - Are football (soccer) referees more likely to give red cards to players with dark skin than to players with light skin?"

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width=340, fig.cap="Mario Balotelli, playing for Manchester City, is shown a red card during a match against Arsenal. (Michael Regan/Getty)"}
knitr::include_graphics(
  here::here(
    "images",
    "card.jpg"
    )
)
```
 

## Example: same data, other conclusions

 - They could analyse the data, and hand in their results and analysis method
 - all 29 methods were distributed to all the other groups anonymously
 - all groups could then alter their analyses if they wanted
 - and discuss what would be the best method.
 

Example issues that were brought up:

 - Is the age of a player a factor? Position on the field? Where the soccer team is from? How many yellow cards a player got previously? Which players are outliers? What kind of statistics should be used?

## Example: same data, other conclusions

 - The research groups could not reach concensus about what would be "the correct solution"
 - 20 groups found a significant effect, 9 did not.

## Reproducible folder structure

drawbacks:

 1. lose files, or the link between files. 
 2. Things will change. 

## Reproducible folder structure

 1. **project = folder** . 
 1. **consistent folder structure ** 
 1. **Do not deep nest folders** 
 1. **Keep information about the data, close to the data**. 
 1. **Store each dataset in its own sub-folder.** 
 1. **Do not change file names or move them.** 
 1. **Do not manually edit data source files.** 
 1. **In code, use relative paths**
